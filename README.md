# Google Docs Clone using Next.js

This is a Next.js project complete with Rich Text Editor using Draft.js, Authentication using NextAuth, Styling done using Material TailwindCSS, and Firebase for Backend Storage.

This project has a functional Rich Text Editor powered by Draft.js, the Document data is stored on Firebase on respective User Logins.
Most of the elements are purely for decoration purpose. Bugs to be fixed later.

This example shows how to use [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) [(v2.2)](https://blog.tailwindcss.com/tailwindcss-2-2) with Next.js. It follows the steps outlined in the official [Tailwind docs](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/guides/nextjs).

It uses the new [`Just-in-Time Mode`](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/just-in-time-mode) for Tailwind CSS.
